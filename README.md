# Progressbar95 Decompiled
A project to decompile Progressbar95
## What is Progressbar95?
Progressbar95 is a hypercasual game made to look like the user interface
of old 90's era operating system, like Windows 95, which the game was based
on. The gameplay is very easy, just fill the progress bar and avoid some
pop-ups.
## Why?
Because we want to add some feature that aren't in the actual release.
